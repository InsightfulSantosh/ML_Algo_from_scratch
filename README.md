# ML_Algo_from_scratch

## Overview
**ML_Algo_from_scratch** is a collection of various Machine Learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python. This repository is intended to help you understand the core mathematical and computational concepts behind popular machine learning algorithms by building them from the ground up.

By implementing these algorithms without relying on popular libraries like `scikit-learn`, this project aims to give you a deep understanding of how each algorithm works, making it easier to grasp the theory behind machine learning.
